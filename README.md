TODO!!!!<br>
1.) query trailer page does not have updated side bar<br>
1.5.) create shipment page needs updated side bar <br>
2.) When querying shipment, we should see a table that shows the pallets for the given pro number and the loose for the given       pro number.<br>
3.) WE NEED A MANAGE CUSTOMERS PAGE, it should be exactly like the employees page but with customers and their addresses instead<br>
4.) Maybe under manage employees you can also select a button to show you fired/not active employees<br>
      BONUS: If looking at non-active/fired employees have the option to rehire
