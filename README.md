TODO!!!!<br>
3.) WE NEED A MANAGE CUSTOMERS PAGE, it should be exactly like the employees page but with customers and their addresses instead<br>
4.) Maybe under manage employees you can also select a button to show you fired/not active employees<br>
      BONUS: If looking at non-active/fired employees have the option to rehire



Updated createShipment procedure: Added insert into shipmentCondition table and set values to 0 because technically we shouldn't be picking up damaged freight.
